# On-Premise

## Subscribing and Deploying On-premise Instances

This section describes the process to deploy a private Thinger.io On-premise instance within minutes by just accessing the [**Pricing Page**](https://pricing.thinger.io) \(On-premise section\) in the "PRICING" link from our [Web Home](https://thinger.io). Just follow the next steps:

### 1. Select the right licence

On-premise instances can be deployed with different licenses, depending on the project requirements, mainly in terms of platform features like rebrands, custom domains, additional support, plugins, etc. On-premise licenses start from free during first month with the Maker license \(4,95€/mo after\), which is limited in some advanced features, most notably, custom domains with automatic SSL support, rebranding, plugins, multiple server accounts, multi-threading support, or extend the server capabilities with plugins like Node-Red. So, the first step is to select the required license from the different ones that are offered in our pricing page.

All these subscriptions include the software license to deploy an on-premise instance on the host of your preference. Note that it is possible to select monthly or yearly license with a great discount. 

The next table shows the main different features that are provided by each license as well as a desirable purpose specification. It is possible to select one license and change it in the future using the [subscription management portal](https://thinger.chargebeeportal.com). 

|  | SMALL | MEDIUM | **LARGE** | **UNLIMITED** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Devices/Assets** | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| **Performance** | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| **Plugins** | 1 | 3 | 5 | Unlimited |
| **Rebranding** | \*\*\*\* | 1 | 5 | Unlimited |
| **Custom Domain/TLS** | \*\*\*\* | 1 | 5 | Unlimited |
| **Developer accounts** | \*\*\*\* | 5 | ✓ | Unlimited |
| **Guest accounts** |  | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| **Extended support** | \*\*\*\* | ✓ | ✓ | Available |
| **HA Cluster** | \*\*\*\* |  |  | Available |
| **Recommended use**  | Individual projects, testing | Business B2B or B2B2C IoT product  | Consultancies with multiple projects | Companies without limits |

### 2.  Configure license

Once the license has been selected, it is possible to customize the service with some options like additional users, support, custom domains, brands, etc. These options appears after selecting any plan, like shown in the figure below:

![Instance license preferences](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28124%29.png)

These options are described in more detail in the following:

* **Admin Email**: This is the email address that must be used when creating the Thinger.io account in the private instance deployed. It will be the main account with admin privileges, allowing to create \(if contracted\) new users, domains, brands, etc.
* **Additional users**: This option allows to increase the amount of accounts \(in addition to the admin account\) in order to allow other users to log-in to your instance. It is possible to add as many accounts as required, however, a large user base will require a better host to support their databases, plugins, etc. 
* **Extended Support**: This option is recommended in order to obtain Thinger.io engineers development support with a 24-48h response time. All accounts can use the [community discussion](https://community.thinger.io) forum to obtain support from other community developers.
* **Custom Domains**: It is the amount of different web domains that can be redirected to the same Private Instance. The instance will automatically provision and renew SSL certificates to support the new defined domains. Domains are required for different brands, as they are associated to the domain name.
* **Custom Brands**: It is the amount of different console brands that can be created over the same instance. In each brand it is possible to customize some accent colors, logos, copyrights, contact emails, title, etc. Notice that each brand requires a custom domain, as the customization is done for each domain name.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that Maker Plan is a limited freemium service that is not configurable and do not allow adding extended support. 
{% endhint %}

### 3.  Checkout and payment options

After configuring the selected license, the checkout process is really simple, just click on the "Deploy Instance" button, and wait for the checkout pop-up. In the new form, it is necessary to introduce your billing email \(it can be different from the admin email\) where the invoices \(if subscribed to a paid plan\) will be sent:

![Billing email](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28238%29.png)

After introducing the billing email, it is necessary to set the billing address. It is possible to set a VAT number if you are a registered company from the European Union in order to calculate the right taxes and build the invoice.

![Billing address](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28114%29.png)

Finally, it is necessary to select the payment method between Credit Card or Direct Debit \(if subscribed to a paid plan\), that allows the domiciliation of the payment with SEPA tansferences. Once the payment process is finished, Thinger.io customer management system will automatically generate a server license that will be emailed to the admin email.

### 4.  On-premise install

Once you have received the license token by email, it is possible to easily deploy Thinger.io on your host with a few commands. Before starting this guide, please, install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) in your computer or server. 

{% hint style="success" %}
Install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose ](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)before following this guide.
{% endhint %}

This guide assumes you are installing Thinger.io on a fresh Linux host with Docker support, as it will run databases like `MongoDB` and `InfluxDB`, and will start listening on several ports: `80`, `443`, `25200`, `25202`, `1883`, and`8883`. It will also create a root directory in `/data` where all the Thinger.io data and database information will be stored.

To start, just launch the following command that will download the `docker-compose` file associated to your license:

```bash
curl https://subscriptions.thinger.io/v1/docker-compose.yml?token={LICENSE} -o docker-compose.yml
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Never share or publish your LICENSE key as it may consist on a security risk for your host. License keys are issued per host, so do not reuse them between hosts.  
{% endhint %}

Ensure that your `docker-compose` file has been downloaded correctly:

```bash
cat docker-compose.yml
```

It should display something like the following:

{% code title="docker-compose.yml" %}
```yaml
version: '3.7'
services:

        max-file: "10"

  # ouroboros
  ouroboros:
    container_name: ouroboros
    hostname: ouroboros

        max-size: "200k"
        max-file: "10"                       
```
{% endcode %}

Then, if everything seems to be correct, just run the following command to start all the processes defined in `docker-compose.yml` and run them in dettached mode with `-d` option:

```yaml
docker-compose up -d
```

If everything goes fine, it should show something like the following information \(it may take several minutes to complete depending on your network connection\):

```bash
root@docker-s-1vcpu-1gb-fra1-01:~# docker-compose up -d

Then, the Thinger.io instance and the associated databases will be running:

```bash

```

Then, you can access your on-premise instance by pointing your browser to your host IP address.

{% hint style="info" %}
The latest versions of Ubuntu comes with ufw \(the default firewall configuration tool for Ubuntu\). It may be blocking Thinger.io ports by default. Configure it properly or disable it \(not recommended\)  with `sudo ufw disable`
{% endhint %}



## Steps After On-premise Deployment

To start working with your on-premise installation, just follow the next steps:

### First Login

1. Access the server by writing the local IP address of your host, for example: [https://1](https://acme.do.thinger.io)92.168.1.100. This step should show the Thinger.io login screen after accepting to use a self-signed certificate \(the browser will ask you about a security issue with the certificate\).
2. Note that this server has never been accessed before, and it is a completely isolated instance so there is not any user account created. Then, it is necessary to click on `Create an account`button, and fill the form to create a new user profile using the `Admin Email` address provided in the license configuration \(any other address will not be authorized to sign up\).
3. After creating the new account it is possible to access the new server. It is not necessary to confirm the mail address.

### Device Connection

When working with a private Thinger.io instance, it is necessary to point your devices to the newly created server. If you are using the [Arduino](../../quick-sart/devices/arduino.md) or [Linux](../../quick-sart/devices/linux.md) client libraries, i.e., for Arduino, ESP8266, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, etc., you should add a definition on top of your code to point to your host. So, modify your sketch like this:

```text
#define THINGER_SERVER "192.168.1.100"

// the rest of your code goes here
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If this host definition is not provided, your devices will try to connect with the public instance. 
{% endhint %}
